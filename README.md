## Notes

Learning to create an iOS app for the very first time was a great experience. It obviously was difficult as i had to unlearn a few things which i carried over from developing Android apps. But i loved every bit of it. 
Furthermore, i would like to add a "Help me decide" button, which would ask the user a bunch of questions and based on the response, assign a tip %. 

I had added icons for the app but it did not end up showing, a fix on the card for consequent versions.
